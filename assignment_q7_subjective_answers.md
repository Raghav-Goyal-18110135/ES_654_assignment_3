## Inferences
- Performace: Transferr Learning > Data Augmentation > Conventional Setting
- Data Augmentation helps in improving accuracy when the size of the dataset is small by generating samples by shifting, flipping, etc. operations on the original images thus increasing the overall size of the dataset.
- Transferr Learning can be highly beneficial for scenarios involving similar tasks. The pretrained dense neural network VGG16 used as an image features extractor in our case results in very high accuracy.
